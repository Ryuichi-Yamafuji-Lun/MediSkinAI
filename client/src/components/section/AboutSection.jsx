                MediSkinAI is an AI-powered platform designed to help you assess potential skin health risks with ease. Using advanced machine learning and the ISIC dataset, our model analyzes images of moles and skin lesions to provide an early indication of whether they might be cancerous. With 91% accuracy, we aim to offer a simple first step in understanding your skin health. While our tool isnâ€™t a medical diagnosis, it helps raise awareness and empowers you to seek professional advice if needed.
